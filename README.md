## General Info

Crush-It is a workout builder which helps sportsmen build their workouts fast and train easily. In Crush-It you can select either predefined workouts and create your templates or select prefined workout templates. The user is of course able to create his custom workouts as well. Once you have created your custom workout or chosen one of our premade workouts, you are free to train.

This is not a real-world project but the purpose of the project is to gain more technical knowledge in the fields of front-end and back-end. My project partner and I are doing it because we want to become very fast at building MVPs. So The only purpose of the project is to become better and quicker at building MVPs.
